# Gamee-Cheat
A cheat that will allow you to score any number of @Gamee points in telegram

# Installation 
For the program to work, you will need to install python. Then you launch the console in the downloaded folder, which you will get from the archive. Then, to start, we will need to register two commands:
### First command
With this command, we install the dependencies of our application (library)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Linux Installation (Windows users should skip this step)
In addition to installing requirements from requirements.txt, you need to separately install Tkinter (Ubuntu Linux, for other distributions, see the search engine):
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

### Last command
With this command we will run the file with the program
"python main.py"

# Use
Just don't put the number of points above the world record (often this will result in a ban because the world record is the maximum points earned honestly). The time is indicated in seconds, so as not to get caught, try to indicate such a time so that the system thinks that you really played for so long to score such a score.

# Annotation
DON'T FORGET TO USE COMMANDS EXACTLY FROM THE FOLDER WITH DOWNLOADED FILES
